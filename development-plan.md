# List Merge Application - Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the development phases for the List Merge application, a web-based tool for merging multiple input lists into a single, manually ranked output list.

## Development Phases

### **Phase 1: Core UI Shell** âœ… COMPLETE
**Goal**: Establish the foundation UI structure and development environment

**Tasks**:
- Initialize React project with Vite and TypeScript
- Configure Tailwind CSS v4 with proper Vite plugin
- Create four-panel layout components (Input Lists, Main List, Properties, Tag Pool)
- Implement basic component structure and navigation
- Set up proper TypeScript imports and module resolution

**Testing**: None needed - UI shell will evolve significantly

---

### **Phase 2: Basic List Management** âœ… COMPLETE
**Goal**: Implement core list operations without drag-and-drop

**Tasks**:
- Manual item addition to input lists (text input + Add button)
- Edit/delete functionality for individual items (inline editing)
- List renaming functionality (click to edit)
- Delete entire input lists
- Move items from input to main list (button-based)
- Remove items from main list
- Basic reordering with up/down buttons
- Multi-select support (Ctrl+click)

**Key Features Implemented**:
- Smart state management (items marked as "used" when moved)
- Bi-directional updates (removing from main list restores availability)
- Visual feedback (hover states, disabled buttons)
- Keyboard support (Enter/Escape keys)
- Source tagging (items automatically tagged with source list)

**Testing**: Too early - state management patterns still evolving

---

### **Phase 3: Drag-and-Drop System**
**Goal**: Replace button-based interactions with intuitive drag-and-drop

**Tasks**:
- Integrate @dnd-kit/core library
- Configure DnD context provider
- Make input list items draggable
- Create drop zones in main list
- Implement visual feedback during drag operations
- Enable reordering within main list via drag-and-drop
- Prevent dragging already-used items
- Add drop zone visual indicators
- Handle drag cancellation and error states

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- Visual feedback during drag operations
- Improved user experience over button-based approach

**Testing**: Still too early - major API changes coming with DnD integration

---

### **Phase 6: File Import/Export**
**Goal**: Enable data import/export functionality

**Tasks**:
- CSV file parsing (single-row format)
- Plain text file import (line-by-line)
- JSON project import/export
- File validation and error handling
- Export format specification
- Import preview functionality
- Error recovery mechanisms

**Data Formats**:
- **CSV**: All entries in single row, comma-separated
- **Text**: Each entry on new line, empty lines ignored
- **JSON**: Complete project data with metadata

**ðŸ§ª ADD INTEGRATION TESTS**: External dependencies introduced
- File parsing functions
- Data validation logic
- Import/export workflows
- Error handling scenarios

---

### **Phase 7: Data Persistence**
**Goal**: Implement robust data storage and project management

**Tasks**:
- LocalStorage integration
- Auto-save functionality (debounced)
- Project loading/saving interface
- Data versioning and schema migration
- Storage quota monitoring
- Data corruption detection and recovery
- Project export for backup

**Advanced Features**:
- Automatic project backups
- Storage usage analytics
- Data compression for large projects
- Offline functionality

**ðŸ§ª ADD PERSISTENCE TESTS**: Data integrity becomes critical
- Storage operations
- Data migration logic
- Auto-save mechanisms
- Quota handling

---

### **Phase 8: Undo/Redo System**
**Goal**: Implement comprehensive action history and undo/redo functionality

**Tasks**:
- Command pattern implementation
- Action history management
- Undo/redo functionality
- Action grouping for related operations
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y)
- Action merging for efficiency
- History persistence across sessions
- Visual undo/redo indicators

**Complex Features**:

## Testing Philosophy

### **Why This Timeline?**
1. **Early phases (1-3)**: APIs change frequently, tests become obsolete quickly
2. **Mid phases (4-5)**: Business logic stabilizes, high-value tests emerge
3. **Integration phases (6-7)**: Component interactions require comprehensive testing
4. **Final phases (8-9)**: Production readiness demands full coverage

### **Testing Priorities**
1. **Business Logic**: Core algorithms and state management
2. **User Workflows**: Critical paths through the application
3. **Data Integrity**: Import/export and persistence operations
4. **Error Handling**: Edge cases and failure scenarios
5. **Performance**: Regression testing for optimization
